### INTRODUCTION<br>

<p style="text-indent:50px;text-align:justify;">Heat treatment involves the use of heating or cooling normally to extreme temperatures to achieve desired results such as hardening or softening of a material. Heat treatment techniques include annealing, precipitation strengthening, tempering, normalizing and quenching. </p>

<p style="text-indent:50px;text-align:justify;">Quenching is the rapid cooling of a workpiece to obtain material properties. It is commonly used to harden steel by introducing martensite. The process of quenching begins with heating the samples and then soaking them. The size, composition and initial temperature of the part and the final properties are the deciding factors in selecting a quenching medium. A quenching medium must cool the metal at a rate rapid enough to produce the desired results. Water as a quenching medium can be used to quench some forms of steel but doesnâ€™t produce good results with tool steels or other alloy steels. Oil is used to quench high speed and oil-hardened steels and is preferred for other steels provided the required hardness can be obtained.</p>

<p style="text-indent:50px;text-align:justify;">Parts that are quenched usually must be aged, tempered or stress relieved to achieve the proper toughness, final hardness, and dimensional stability.
